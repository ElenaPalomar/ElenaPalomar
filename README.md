### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Elena and I'm a Front-end developer.
Now I'm looking for a web developer position, but I don't waste my time because I love programming and I keep working on my personal projects until someone discover my talent.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML5, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React, Node JS y SQLite
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related with this world
- ðŸ“« You can reach me in my profile on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-palomar/
- âš¡ Fun fact: One thing I want to do in my life is "hunt" a tornado
